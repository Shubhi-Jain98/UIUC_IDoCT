# Illinois Dataset of Configuration Tests (IDoCT)

The goal of the IDoCT project is to develop a dataset of Configuration Tests (aka Ctests). Ctests are a new type of tests for detecting failure-inducing configuration changes; they can also be used to test source-code changes under different configurations. Compared with existing unit tests, ctests are more versatile and powerful. OTOH, Ctest is still a research idea, but not yet a common practice. The detailed discussion of Ctests is described in [this paper](https://tianyin.github.io/pub/ctest.pdf).

The [openctest](https://github.com/xlab-uiuc/openctest) project provides many more Ctest utilities and datasets, but this repo is self-contained.

We have been using IDoCT for Software Engineering education and REU programs at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Please refer to [the IDoCT onboarding task](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12zoCmQViY3MOvRCqf0aBXikj_A1zh3Lq48vZttayPhw/edit) if you want to join the project.
